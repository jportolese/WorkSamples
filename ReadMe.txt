The directories in this repository contain projects I've worked and course certificates I've received in the field of Remote Sensing and GIS. I've also included a lot of my work in SQL.  My current position is a database programmer with some GIS requirements.  I've taken courses and done tutorials in order to keep up and improve my skills in Remote Sensing and GIS which I received a Masters Degree some years ago.

I'll give a brief description of what each directory contains and update it as I add additional projects, code snippets and links to applications.


ArcPY 

This contains a course certificate that I completed in 2020 for the ArcPy library.  It also contains a quick ArcPy script I used to automate some map 
creation.  

Covid19Data 

The NY times data set of covid case totals by county is an excellent but morbid dataset for aggregation and visualizations.  Included here is a jupyter
notebook that includes a short snippet of code to pull down the latest version of the data (updated daily) and write it to a SQL express instance.  The 
.sql file is code I used to convert the raw numbers to case densities and aggregated, determined growth rates at the state and county level.  

Data Science 

This currently includes the certificate I received for completing a 9 course study of Data Science using R.  I completed several projects including a 
recommendation systems (like the netflix challenge) and a capstone project.  The project code can be found in another repository of mine.  I included
a pdf of the final R markdown in the R directory

Drone Work

I'm a certified drone pilot since 2018 and have a dji Mavic Pro drone that I fly mostly for fun.  I've worked with most of the image processing packages to process my final photos.  This shows a very high resolution orthomosaic of a school construction site in Weymouth Massachusetts.  Over 500 photos were taken and stitched together using DroneDeploy in this case but I've worked with Pix4D as well.  I've also included an animation through a point cloud I created using the pix4D software.

OpenCV

This directory contains the certificate I got for completing a course in Python's OpenCV library.  It also contains a jupyter notebook of code used to create a program to determine the number of fingers I held up in front of my webcam.  The program writes a video file and I've included the video file that was output showing how effective the counter is.

OpenSourceGIS

I completed a short GDAL course and wrote some simple exports from a sql spatial table in Microsoft SQL server to shapefile format using ogr2ogr.

Pandas

After completing a course in Pandas I created this Jupyter Notebook that imported some disease data by county and manipulated it in pandas dataframes. I plan to work with this info to see how much of a correlation there is between things like high rates of diabetes, smoking, and obesity in a county and the number of deaths from covid 19 due to these comorbidities.

REICaseStudy

This was an assessment I took for a potential job opportunity.  I was asked to create a retail growth strategy for REI using some provided demographic, store performance, and available space info in the study area.  I performed most of the project in SQL server and ArcGIS.  The code I used to determine my strategy is included here and shows my advanced SQL skills.  The slide show includes maps and an explanation of the project. 

Remote Sensing

Includes several course certificates as well as a word doc with links to two Google Earth Engine time series projects 

RProject

This includes and R markdown (saved as html) of the capstone project I completed for my data science certificate.

Visualization

Includes two visualizations.  One is a time series of Covid Case density using ArcGIS and python for data engineering and the other is another coronavirus related visualization using the Flourish software.
